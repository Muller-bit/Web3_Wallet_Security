### 🔗 Securely Navigating Web3: An Introduction to Transaction Verification

- Welcome to this guide on verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of this lesson is to walk you through a real transaction, demonstrating the process and highlighting the essential checks you must perform before approving any interaction with a decentralized application (DApp). While we will be using a live DApp, Aave, on the Ethereum mainnet for illustrative purposes, please note that for learning and practice, simulated environments are often recommended and will be explored in future lessons. The core takeaway is empowering you to verify transactions independently, safeguarding you against potential scams or costly errors.
