### 🔗 Securely Navigating Web3: An Introduction to Transaction Verification

- Welcome to this guide on verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of this lesson is to walk you through a real transaction, demonstrating the process and highlighting the essential checks you must perform before approving any interaction with a decentralized application (DApp). While we will be using a live DApp, Aave, on the Ethereum mainnet for illustrative purposes, please note that for learning and practice, simulated environments are often recommended and will be explored in future lessons. The core takeaway is empowering you to verify transactions independently, safeguarding you against potential scams or costly errors.

### 🔗 Understanding Decentralized Finance: A Look at Aave

- o understand transaction verification in context, let's first look at a popular DApp: Aave (app.aave.com). Aave is a prominent example of a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol. It functions as a borrowing and lending platform, much like a traditional bank, where users can deposit various cryptocurrencies to earn interest (yield) or borrow assets by providing collateral.

- A crucial distinction of protocols like Aave is their non-custodial nature. This means the Aave team or any central entity does not have control over your deposited tokens. You, the user, always maintain control over your assets. The protocol operates autonomously, governed 100% by its underlying code—smart contracts—deployed on the blockchain. This autonomy and user control are foundational aspects of Web3 and the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
