### 🔗 Securely Navigating Web3: An Introduction to Transaction Verification

- Welcome to this guide on verifying transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The goal of this lesson is to walk you through a real transaction, demonstrating the process and highlighting the essential checks you must perform before approving any interaction with a decentralized application (DApp). While we will be using a live DApp, Aave, on the Ethereum mainnet for illustrative purposes, please note that for learning and practice, simulated environments are often recommended and will be explored in future lessons. The core takeaway is empowering you to verify transactions independently, safeguarding you against potential scams or costly errors.

### 🔗 Understanding Decentralized Finance: A Look at Aave

- o understand transaction verification in context, let's first look at a popular DApp: Aave (app.aave.com). Aave is a prominent example of a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol. It functions as a borrowing and lending platform, much like a traditional bank, where users can deposit various cryptocurrencies to earn interest (yield) or borrow assets by providing collateral.

- A crucial distinction of protocols like Aave is their non-custodial nature. This means the Aave team or any central entity does not have control over your deposited tokens. You, the user, always maintain control over your assets. The protocol operates autonomously, governed 100% by its underlying code—smart contracts—deployed on the blockchain. This autonomy and user control are foundational aspects of Web3 and the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

### 🔗 Connecting Your Wallet: The Gateway to DApps

- Interacting with most DApps begins by connecting your cryptocurrency wallet. Typically, you'll find a "Connect wallet" button prominently displayed on the DApp's website. For this demonstration, we'll connect to Aave using MetaMask:

Navigate to the Aave website (app.aave.com) and click the "Connect wallet" button.

A list of compatible wallet options will appear; select "MetaMask."

MetaMask will prompt you with a connection request, asking for permission to connect a specific account from your wallet to the Aave site. Review the account and click "Connect."

- Once successfully connected, the Aave interface will update to reflect your wallet's connection status and may display relevant information such as your asset balances. For instance, you might see your wallet name (e.g., "small testnet") and its current balance (e.g., ~$23) displayed within Aave, confirming it's linked to the Ethereum mainnet.
